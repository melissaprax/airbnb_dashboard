Yesterday I learned that a histogram on a linear y-axis does not accurately display the full range of price data.

Furthermore, few insights can be gleaned without further disaggregation beyond the level of neighbourhood group.

I experimented with a violin plot with a logarithmic y-axis scale in R, grouped by room type. 

That was a much more effective plot than the histogram. However, it does not bode well with the current drop-down design as the user
would not be able to make comparisons between areas of NYC if upon dropdown selection, the violin plot only displayed 1 group at a time.

Secondly, the word cloud takes a very long time to generate because of the name field's string processing in JavaScript.

The word frequency calculation needs to be performed in app.py.

Thirdly, this application need be set up with the near complete API.

Step 1: Make a violin plot with price and room type data.

Step 2: Process the airbnb.name word frequency data in python and set up a route for this data.

Step 3: Test this application with the full API.
